    <h3>MY NAME</h3>
    <img src="portrait_meadows.jpeg" alt="image">
    <!-- <img src="../swagner/butterfly.jpeg" style="float: left"-->
    <p>I am currently a PhD student in the Centre for Language Evolution at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [x] and [y]. My research interests lie in the acquisition and processing of inflectional morphology, which I test through artificial language learning experiments, in the lab and online. My PhD focuses on the impact of transparency on the learnability of L2 inflections across populations of speakers of different L1s.</p>
    <p>I obtained my Master of Arts and my Bachelor of Arts from the University of Freiburg.</p>
    <p>Apart from research, I am passionate about learning new skills, teaching, and have worked and volunteered as a swimming instructor for over 15 years.</p>
